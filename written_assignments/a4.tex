If $u\rightsquigarrow x \rightarrow y$ is a shortest path, then the length of this path is $\delta(y)$. If before $x$ entered $N'$, $D(y)$ was some value greater than $\delta(y)$, then after $x$ is added to $N'$ the value of $D(y)$ will be updated to $\delta(y)$. Therefore at this stage in the algorithm, $D(y) = \delta(y)$.
